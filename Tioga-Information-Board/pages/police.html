                    To All In Tioga Congregation: <br>

                    This is to inform you that the body of elders has decided that the entire congregation should meet
                    virtually on Zoom until
                    Sunday, June 12th due to some local concerns and out of an abundance of caution. You may use the
                    meeting ID and Passcode
                    to log in at the same meeting times and days as usual.

                    Updated information will be shared with you through announcements, your group overseers, and by
                    means of this e-board as
                    it becomes available. Feel free to reach out to your group overseer with any questions or concerns
                    you may have.<br>
                    Your brothers,<br>Body of Elders</p>
