                    In the light of the recent announcement from the branch office regarding resuming features of the
                    Public
                    Ministry, this is to inform the congregation that the body of elders is currently organizing matters
                    so that we can again engage in various forms of the Public Ministry. An announcement will be made
                    with direction in this regard. We ask that all be patient as we
                    consider safe and practical measures that will benefit all.<br>
                    Your brothers,<br>Body of Elders</p>
