                    This is to inform the congregation that we will resume in-person meetings tonight - Thursday, June
                    16, 2022,
                    for our midweek meeting. The issues that prevented us from meeting in person have apparently been
                    resolved. We take this opportunity to thank you all for your patience and cooperation.<br><br>
                    Your brothers,<br>Body of Elders <br>

            Under the "Forms" tab, a form has been provided for entering your up-to-date contact information, including
            your emergency contact(s) in the event of an emergency. You may print it out and keep a copy for your
            records. If you have not already done so, please-as soon as
            possible-provide this
            information to your group overseer who will, in turn, ensure that the secretary has it for the files. If you
            have any questions, please reach out to your group overseer for assistance.
