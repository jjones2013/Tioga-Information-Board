                    Due to a recent issue in building "B" regarding the sound equipment, we all will meet
                    virtually until further notice. The congregation will be informed

            Under the "Forms" tab, a form has been provided for entering your up-to-date contact information, including
            your emergency contact(s) in the event of an emergency. You may print it out and keep a copy for your
            records. If you have not already done so, please-as soon as
            possible-provide this
            information to your group overseer who will, in turn, ensure that the secretary has it for the files. If you
            have any questions, please reach out to your group overseer for assistance.
